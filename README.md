# theory_of_mind
This is the code I wrote for a group project at KOSMOS (Konstanz summer school modelling social and collective behaviour).

## Background

Theory of mind can be loosely described as inferring the behaviours of others by using a model of how their mind works. I have absolutely no experience in the topic: nevertheless, it appears to me as an interesting framework, for example to study the evolution of deception in animal communication (maybe?). The code presented here is the simplest possible set-up for a theory of mind scenario where there is only one individual making a sequence of decisions about what food to eat ("dessert", "fruit" or "garbage") depending on the internal quality he associates with every food option. As an external observer, the qualities values of the individual are unknown, and the theory of mind task is to infer them from its sequence of choices. Despite the setup is extremely simple, it is useful to understand the concept of likelihood.

## Code
I first simulate the sequence of food choices for an individual. To infer the qualities, I calculate the likelihood of a random combination of candidate values. The inferred qualities will be the combination of values associated with the minimum negative log likelihood. The likelihood is the probability that the observed sequence of choices (the data) was generated by the combination of qualities values (the parameters). The "model" linking quality values to the decision is the softmax function.
